# Victus

This project is based on blockchain application for keeping track of a person’s medical history. It’s a dapp that aims at helping out clients for maintaining their records and safeguards them against any frauds. Clients can freely store their prescriptions,bills and reports in this dapp 
without the fear of them getting misplaced.



## Objectives

* Victus will ensure that the users will not be fooled or cheated from the hospital’s side. In case if they try to manipulate the bill, victus dapp will not let that happen. Moreover clients ,who maintain their medical records on victus ,even after displacing their phone or mobile number can access their records through their Id.

* Victus will employ good data practices to make sure sensitive data recorded in it via the users aren’t open to exploitation.

*	Victus can be used to make intelligent record tracing dapp for even maintaining old records among the wide population.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
